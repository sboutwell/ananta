# Ananta #

Ananta is a single player open-ended top-down space simulation game heavily influenced by [Elite II Frontier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier:_Elite_II), [Privateer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Commander:_Privateer), [Terminus](http://vvisions.logical.net/terminus) and [X-series](http://www.egosoft.com/games/x/info_en.php). It features full Newtonian physics and simulates solar systems with bodies gravitationally bound to each other.

The project is currently in active pre-alpha stage, with only a _technology preview_ version available.

Ananta is written in [BlitzMax](http://www.blitzbasic.com), a basic-style OO-language aimed for game development. Source is available through the Subversion repository and periodical source snapshots in the download section.

There is also a development worklog for the project [over here](http://www.blitzbasic.com/logs/userlog.php?user=9969&log=1603)
