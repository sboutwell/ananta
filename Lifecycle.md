Ananta will start small. It will have many intermediate releases that are something very different to its [projected future](vision.md).

I remember one arts class in grammar school. In the beginning of the semester we were each given a huge canvas and got an assignment to start drawing on it. It was to be a project lasting the whole year, and we were supposed to add more content to the drawing every week. The teacher told us to draw anything we wanted, but asked to start with the 'big picture', and progress towards smaller details.

I started with a landscape with few hills, a cloud and a tree. It was simple but looked like a working piece of art (for a 10-year-old!) after just an hour of work.

Few months later it had a river in the foreground teeming with life: ducks, alligators, turtles, etc. It also had a small fisherman's hut with its occupant angling on a pier.

By the end of the semester I had added a huge skyscraper city in the background, complete with rows of 40-story windows with incredibly small details. Aircraft were flying over the sky dropping skydivers, and there was a distant thunderstorm far in the horizon. It had more details than Don Rosa's Donald Duck stories.

Ananta will be something similar. The initial release will be a simple but working game; maybe not the full economic simulator described in the pipe dream page, but something that will be fun to play nevertheless. The beauty of games of this genre is that once the basic engine is built and turned into something playable, you can always keep expanding and adding more features to it. The intention is that Ananta will never be "finished". In fact, that's one meaning behind the working title: Ananta is a sanskrit word for 'eternal', 'endless' or 'infinite'.

A game project with no deadlines or set goals. How cool is that? ;)

It's not going to be all fun and games, though. This wouldn't be the first open-source software project to wither away and die due to the lack of decent planning. The project will need to have intermediate goals and the developers should try to stick to the plan. It should not require central management and ruling with an iron fist if all the developers have a clear vision of the milestones (read: releases) that need to be reached. I believe in unmanaged open-source projects, but it will require at least someone with enough willpower to see that the critical goals are pursued.
